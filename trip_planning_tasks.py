   Key Steps for Task Creation
    1. Identify Desired outcome: define what success looks like for your project.
        - A detailed 7 day travel itinerary
    2. Task Breakdown: Divide the goal into smaller, manageable tasks that agents can execute.  
        - Itinerary Planning: develop a detailed plan for each day of the trip.
        - City selection: analyze and pick the best cities to visit.
        - Local Tour Guide: Find a local expert to provide insights and recommendations.
   3. Assign Tasks to Agents: Match tasks with agents based on their roles and responsibilities. 
   4. Task Description template:
      - Use this template as a guide to define each tasks in your CrewAI application.
      - This template helps ensure that each task is clearly defined, actionable and aligned with the specific goals of the project.
